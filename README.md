# ES6 example of parent and child container - function exchange

A very simple app that helped me to understand how to pass a function down as prop to child components and how they in turn return input to the parent. State in this way in managed in one component and this component can pass its data down to other child components. As simple as this exmple is, it'll be a useful reference when apps become more complex and look back on how to manage state in a container component and gather and pass it to children.
